# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant technical decisions in geoparquet-io.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR captures an architecturally significant decision along with its context and consequences. ADRs are:

- **Immutable once accepted**: We don't edit accepted ADRs. If a decision changes, we create a new ADR that supersedes the old one.
- **Numbered sequentially**: ADR-0001, ADR-0002, etc.
- **Short and focused**: Each ADR covers one decision.

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy `template.md` to `NNNN-short-title.md` (next number in sequence)
2. Fill in all sections
3. Set status to "Proposed"
4. Open a PR for review
5. After merge, update status to "Accepted"
